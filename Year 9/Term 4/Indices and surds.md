# Indices and surds
**Describe surds**
- [ ] Describe a real number as a number that can be represented by a point on the number line
- [ ] Examine the differences between rational and irrational numbers and recognise that all rational and irrational numbers are real
- [ ] Convert between recurring decimals and their fractional form using digital tools
- [ ] Describe the term _surd_ as referring to irrational expressions of the form $\sqrt[n]{x}$ where $x$ is a rational number and $n$ is an integer such that $n \geq 2$, and $x \gt 0$ when $n$ is even
- [ ] Recognise that a surd is an exact value that can be approximated by a rounded decimal
- [ ] Demonstrate that $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $x \lt 0$ and that $\sqrt{x}=0$ when $x=0$ using digital tools
- [ ] Describe $\sqrt{x}$ as the positive square root of $x$ for $x \gt 0$ and $\sqrt{0} = 0$ 

**Apply knowledge of surds to solve problems**
- [ ] Establish and apply the following results for $x \gt 0$ and $y \gt 0$: 
	- $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x = \sqrt{x^2}$
	- $\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}$
	- $\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}$
- [ ] Apply the 4 operations to simplify expressions involving surds
- [ ] Expand and simplify expressions involving surds
- [ ] Rationalise the denominators of surds of the form $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c\sqrt{d}}$

**Describe and use fractional indices**
- [ ] Apply index laws to describe fractional indices as:
	- $a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$
	- $a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$
- [ ] Translate expressions in surd form to expressions in index form and vice versa
- [ ] Evaluate numerical expressions involving fractional indices including using digital tools
