# Data analysis
**Identify and describe numerical datasets involving 2 variables**
- [ ] Distinguish between situations involving 1-variable and 2-variable (bivariate) data and explain when each is needed
- [ ] Explain the difference between variables that have an association and variables that have a causal relationship
- [ ] Identify and describe the independent variable and dependent variable in relationships with possible cause and effect

**Represent datasets involving 2 numerical variables, using a scatter plot and a line of best fit, by eye**
- [ ] Gather data on a topic of interest involving 2 numerical variables
- [ ] Represent the data using a scatter plot
- [ ] Create a line of best fit, by eye, on an existing scatter plot

**Interpret data involving 2 numerical variables, using graphical representations**
- [ ] Describe informally the association between 2 numerical variables and apply terminology about form (linear), strength (strong, moderate or weak) and direction (positive or negative)
- [ ] Use the line of best fit, by eye, to make predictions between known data values (interpolation) and what might happen beyond known data values (extrapolation)
- [ ] Explain the limitations of the model when making predictions
