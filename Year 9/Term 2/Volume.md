# Volume
**Solve problems involving volumes**
- [ ] Find the volume of right pyramids and right cones by using an appropriate formula: volume of pyramid or cone $V=\frac{1}{3}Ah$, where $A$ is the base area and $h$ is the perpendicular height
- [ ] Find the volume of spheres by using an appropriate formula: volume of sphere $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the length of the radius
- [ ] Apply knowledge of right pyramids, right cones and hemispheres to solve problems involving composite solids
- [ ] Solve practical problems related to the volumes and capacities of solids including right pyramids, right cones and spheres
