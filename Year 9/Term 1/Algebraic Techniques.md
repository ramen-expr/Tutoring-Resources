# Algebraic Techniques
**Apply the 4 operations involving algebraic fractions with pronumerals in the denominator**
- [ ] Simplify algebraic fractions, including those involving indices
- [ ] Simplify expressions that involve operations with algebraic fractions, including algebraic fractions that involve pronumerals in the denominator and/or indices

**Factorise algebraic expressions by taking out a common algebraic factor**
- [ ] Factorise algebraic expressions, including those involving indices, by determining the highest common factors (HCF) including negative coefficients/pronumerals

**Expand binomial products and factorise monic quadratic expressions**
- [ ] Expand binomial products
- [ ] Factorise monic quadratic trinomial expressions
- [ ] Solve problems involving expansion and factorisation of algebraic expressions

**Operate with algebraic fractions involving binomial numerators and numerical denominators**
- [ ] Add and subtract algebraic fractions with binomial numerators and numerical denominators

**Expand, factorise and simplify algebraic expressions including special products**
- [ ] Prove and apply these special products:
	- [ ] $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$
	- [ ] $(a+b)(a+b) = a^2 +2ab + b^2$
	- [ ] $(a-b)(a-b) = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
- [ ] Expand and simplify a variety of algebraic expressions including binomial products and the special products
- [ ] Factorise algebraic expressions involving the special products and strategies, including common factors, grouping in pairs for 4-term expressions and quadratic trinomials (monic and non-monic)
- [ ] Simplify algebraic expressions involving algebraic fractions using factorisation
